            <p class="paragraph">
              I recently entered into the wonderful world of fatherhood! It's been quite the journey thus far, full of late nights and precious moments.
              Being a father is something I've quickly come to enjoy immensely and I can't wait to watch her grow up (and maybe even teach her to program)!

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Developer</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              If you've met me, you know some of my favorite words are, "I love programming". I'm a huge advocate for it and I think everyone
              should learn to do it on some level. Day or night I rarely stop thinking about it. Current projects, deciding on my next language to learn,
              or dreaming up ideas to carry out; one of those things is usually on my brain.

            <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small">Collaborator</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              I am an introvert by nature and working alone has its joys, but there's just something I really about brainstorming with a group of people and
              coming up with ideas and solutions together. If you have an idea and want a partner shoot me a message!

              Some would say this is pretty sparse for a personal webpage. I get it. The thing is I'm not a blogger and generally a man of few words in person as well.
              I also very much enjoy creating useful tools for other people and prefer spending my time doing that. I place more value in that than thinking other
              people are interested in coming here to read about my personal life.
